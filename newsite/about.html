                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr />
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>In 2015 I received a Bachelor of Science degree from Redeemer University with two majors in honours mathematics and four-year computer science. When I was at Redeemer I enjoyed 4 summers of undergraduate student research. Three of them were NSERC USRA funded endeavours, the fourth was funded independently by the professor. The first two summers I worked with Dr. Kevin Vander Meulen. We investigated Linear Algebra and Graph Theory and how the patterns of zero, non-zero, and variable entries in matrices effected the spectrum of eigenvalues. The <a href="research.html" title="Research">research</a> page has a summary of each publication that came out of these summers. The final two summers I worked for Dr. Darren Brouwer, a professor of chemistry at Redeemer. We investigated the link between crystalline zeolite structures and Delaney traingulizations. In particular, this combinatoric tool is capable of recreating all theoretical zeolite crystals achievable by chemists. The second summer we used genetic algorithms to reconstruct atomic positioning of structures via dipole-dipole interactions gathered by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. </p>
                <p>In 2017 I received a Master of Science degree from McMaster University for my work in mathematical biology under my supervisor Dr. Gail Wolkowicz. My thesis was entitled</p>
<blockquote>DEMONSTRATING THE SENSITIVITY OF CHEMOSTAT PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEMS TO THE FUNCTIONAL FORM OF HOLLING TYPE II PREDATOR RESPONSE FUNCTIONS</blockquote>
<p>A summary of my thesis and a link to the pdf can be found in the <a href="research.html" title="Research">research</a> page of this site.</p>
                <p>Currently I am a Ph.D candidate at the University of Waterloo in mathematical oncology, a part of the mathematical medicine group, under my supervisor Dr. Mohammad Kohandel. </p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I enjoy anything outdoors-related. Hiking, camping, and scuba diving are fond hobbies of mine. I regularly cycle and try to get out for at least a 20km ride each week. I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy and, when I find myself with rare free-time, I enjoy playing (and running) table-top roleplaying games like Pathfinder and Fate.</p>


                <h2>Computing</h2>
                <p>I enjoy writing code. I started writing code when I was 12 years old. At first I learned how to write CSS and HTML solely for the purpose of customising my own, and my friends, MySpace pages. As the years went on I developed numerous websites for local pool companies, scuba diving shops, boat charters, bands, etc.</p>
                <p>Around this time I started learning Actionscript 2.0 for the purpose of programming Flash applications. This was primarily driven by my desire to create flash video games, but also flash animations and applets for use on the websites I was creating.</p>
                <p>Somewhere along the way I became interested in more serious programming, and learned how to code in .NET, Perl, PHP, and Python before moving onto University where I learned C, Maple, Matlab, R, Mathematica, and Java.</p>
                <p>Having spent more than half of my life writing code I am comfortable picking up any object-oriented language with ease. Functional languages, like Mathematica, typically require more serious study before I feel comfortable producing any code of value. </p>
